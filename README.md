# Remap motorSpeed - ck62

After buying the keyboard I discovered some problems in the development of it, nothing that makes it very bad, just that it does not make it one of the best 60% keyboards, I work as a programmer and needed faster access to some keys, which it is not possible to do it only with the FN of the keyboard, in this case using the [Autohotkey ](https://www.autohotkey.com/) software to script the remapping of the keys, making all the keys that should be used by the FN start to be accessed by the capslock (they keep working access by FN).

To use the remap script just download the file '**MotorSpeed-ck62.AHK**' and double click on it, it will already be running, to edit the script any editor like vscode can be used.
